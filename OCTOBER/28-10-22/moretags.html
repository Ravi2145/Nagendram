            Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub", because the system checked backlinks to
        estimate the importance of a site.[20][30][31] Hassan as well as <a href="SignUp.html">Go to Singup</a>
        Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as
        being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and
        Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search
        engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff Ullman were also cited as contributors to the
        project.[32] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for
        RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier
        RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[
