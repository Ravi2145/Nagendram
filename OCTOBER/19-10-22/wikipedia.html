        <h2>Dogs</h2>
        <p>The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5])
             is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail. 
             <b>The dog is derived from an ancient,</b> extinct wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is 
             the dog's nearest living relative.[8] The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8]
             by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[7] before the development of agriculture

            <p>
                <b> Due to their long association with humans</b>, dogs 
                have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals[10]
                 and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that
                  would be inadequate for other canids.[11] Over the millennia, 
                  dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and 
                the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study
