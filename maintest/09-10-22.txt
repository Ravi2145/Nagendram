Amy has an array A, of N integers. A [i] denotes the ith element. She defines the “disturbance” value, D, of the array as:

n−1

D = ∑A[i] − (N − 1) ∗ A[N ]

i=1



In one operation you can chose to index X and Y (1<=X, Y<=N) such that X is not equal to Y, and increase A[X] by 1 and decrease A[Y] by 1.



Find the minimum absolute value of D that you can obtain after performing the operation several times (possibly zero).



You are given T independent test cases.



Constraints



• 1 <= T <= 102

• 3 <= N <= 104

• 1 <= A[i] <= 106

• All input values are integers.



Input Format



• First-line contains T.

• First line of each test case consists of a single integer N.

• Second line of each test case consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.



Output Format



Print in a newline for each test case a single integer denoting the minimum absolute value of D that you can obtain after performing the operation several times (possibly zero).

Explanation of Sample 1



For 1st test case, D = (A[1] +A[2]) – (3-1)*A[3] = 4 – 2*2 = 4 – 4 = 0 For 2ndtest case,

Do one operation by choosing X = 3 and Y = 4, so array becomes A = [ 2, 5, 4, 4] D = (A[1] +A[2] + A[3]) – (4-1)*A[4] = 11 – 3*4 = 11 – 12 = -1

Minimum absolute value of D is 1.






2.There is an array A consisting of N integers from 1 to N (each exactly once)., i.e., A = [1, 2, 3, …., N].

Anne and Emmy together choses a non-empty subsequence S of array A. Now they wanted Amy to guess this subsequence.

Anne gave her hint that it is guaranteed that the subsequence doesn’t have length X. Emmy also gave her a hint that it is guaranteed that the subsequence doesn’t have length Y.

Amy wants you to find how many sub sequences are there that she can guess using the hints. If the answer is large print, it modulo 10^9 + 7.

You are given T independent test cases.

NOTE: Subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. You can erase any elements, not necessarily going successively. The remaining elements preserve their order.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 5
3 <= N <= 10^9
1 <= X, Y <= MIN (N, 10^5)
All input values are integers.
Input Format

First-line contains T.
Next T lines each contains three space separated integers N, X and Y.
Output Format

Print in a newline for each test case a single integer denoting the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Explanation of Sample 1

A = [1, 2, 3]

Possible sub sequences are:

[1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1, 3], [2, 3] and [1, 2, 3]

Now according to hint by Anne, sub sequence they chose doesn’t have length X = 2

So, we are left with: [1], [2], [3], [1, 2, 3]

Now according to hint by Emmy, sub sequence they chose doesn’t have length Y = 1

So, we are left with: [1, 2, 3]

So, there is only one possible sub sequence that Amy can guess.
