// Question Name: Bubu the minion

// Problem Statement

// Bubu, the minion has been invited to a birthday party. Bubu has been given two plates. The first plate has N Roties in 
// it and the second plate has M Roti. The Roties have been aligned in these plates one on top of the other in form of a 
// stack as shown below. The tastiness of the ith Roti in the first plate is Ai and the tastiness of the ith Roti in the 
// second plate is Bi.

// Bubu has a maximum capacity of K. This means that the sum of the tastiness of all the Roties that Bubu eats must be 
// less than or equal to K. Bubu canâ€™t take Rotis from between the stacks i.e for eating Roti i from a plate, Bubu must
// eat all the Rotis 1<=j<=i-1 from that plate. Given the arrays A and B describing the tastiness of the Rotis in both 
// the plates, print the maximum number of roties Bubu can eat such that the sum of the tastiness of all the Roties that 
// Bubu eats in total from both the plates is atmost K.

// Input Format

// First line contains three space separated integers denoting K, N, and M.
// Output Format

// Print the maximum number of roties Bubu can eat such that the sum of the tastiness of all the Roties that Bubu eats in 
// total from both the plates is atmost K.
// Constraints

// 1<=K<=10^9
// 1<=N,M<=2*10^5
// 1<=Ai, Bi<=10^9
// Sample Input 1

// 240 3 4

// 60 90 120

// 80 150 80 150

// Output 1

// 3

// Explanation of Sample 1

// Bubu can eat first and second roti from first plate, and first roti from second plate.

// Total sum of tastiness = 60+90+80 = 230 which is less than K( = 240).
