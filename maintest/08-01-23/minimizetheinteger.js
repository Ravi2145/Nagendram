// Question Name: Minimize the integer

// Problem Statement

 

// Antonio got a very large integer as his Christmas present from his parents. Antonio does not like large integers and hence decided to change a few digits of this integer and make it as small as possible.

 

// But changing too many digits will make Antonio’s parents sad. More formally if Antonio changes more than K digits of the integer, his parents will become sad. Antonio does not want that to happen and hence will change at most K digits of the given integer.

 

// Also if the final integer contains any leading zeroes, Antonio’s parents again become sad. So Antonio will perform the K changes in such a way that the final integer does not contain any leading zeroes.

 

// Given the integer Antonio got and K(maximum number of changes Antonio can perform), print the minimum integer that Antonio can get.

 

 

// Input Format

 

// First line contains a single integer denoting the integer Antonio got as his Christmas present.
 

// Next line contains a single integer denoting K.
 

 

// Output Format

 

// Print the minimum integer that Antonio can get.
 

// Constraints

 

// 1<=number of digits in the integer<=105
 

// 1<=K<=number of digits in the integer
 

// Its guaranteed that the given integer does not contain any leading zeros.
 

 

// Sample Input 1

 

// 2399

// 2

 

 

// Sample Output 1

 

// 1099

 

// Explanation of Sample 1

 

// Antonio can change the first digit to ‘1’ and change the second digit to ‘0’. It can be proved that 1099 is the minimum possible integer that Antonio can get.
